# Random Password Generator

This is an application that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript code. 


## Description

Password length will need to be no less than 8 and no greater than 128.

The password can include special character types such as :
- Lower case
- Upper case
- Numeric values
- Special characters 

console.log has been added throughout the script to ensure that there are no errors within the code. 
[This can be removed if necessary]
